### Steps to Analyze a PE File and Extract Dependencies

1. **Read the DOS Header (IMAGE_DOS_HEADER)**
    - Locate the `e_lfanew` offset, which points to the PE header.

2. **Follow `e_lfanew` to Locate the PE Signature**
    - Verify that the PE signature ("PE\0\0") is present, confirming it is a valid PE file.

3. **Read the NT Headers (IMAGE_NT_HEADERS)**
    - Access the File Header and Optional Header within the NT Headers.

4. **In the Optional Header, Locate the Import Table Directory Entry**
    - Identify the entry that points to the Import Directory.

5. **Follow the Import Table to the Import Directory (IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR)**
    - Iterate through each `IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR` to analyze the dependencies.

6. **Extract the DLL Names from Each Descriptor's `Name` Field**
    - Use the `Name` field in each `IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR` to retrieve the names of the required DLLs.

7. **(Optional) Handle Delay-Loaded DLLs**
    - Parse the Delay-Load Import Directory (if applicable) to identify any DLLs that are loaded on demand.

### Summary
By following these steps, we extract all the DLL dependencies required by an executable, which are essential for understanding the external libraries the PE file relies on.
